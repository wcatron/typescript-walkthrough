# GraphQL Generated Types

There are times when types can be generated for you. For example when generating code from swagger documentation or when working with another technology that values typed interfaces like GraphQL.

- Use [./src/schema.ts] to generate types including resolver types. Add script `"generate": "graphql-codegen"` and run `yarn generate`.
- Write resolvers with types provided.

```ts
// index.ts
import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server";
import typeDefs from './schema'
import resolvers from './resolvers'

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
});

// resolvers.ts
import { User, QueryResolvers, UserResolvers, Role } from "./graphql"

const user = (id: string): User => {
  return {
    id,
    email: 'email@email.com',
    username: 'hello_world',
    role: Role.User
  }
}

const Query:QueryResolvers = {
  me: () => {
    return user('123')
  },
  user: (_, { id }) => {
    return user(id)
  }
}

const userResolvers: UserResolvers = {
  email: (user) => {
    return `${user.email} <${user.username}>`
  }
}

export default {
  Query,
  User: userResolvers
}
```

## Notes

- This entire approach to typing GQL goes against the "code-first" recommendation for writing GQL schema. This is more of a "schema-first, types-second, code-last".
- The GQL schema is from [this code-gen demo](https://graphql-code-generator.com/live-demo/).

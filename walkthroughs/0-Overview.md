# Overview

This will be a quick summary of concepts and features that show the benefits of Typescript when compared to Javascript.

## What is Typescript?

- TypeScript is a typed superset of Javascript that compiles to plain Javascript.

## Why use Typescript? Why is it better than Javascript?

- When writing Javascript a developer still must think about the types of objects being used. Typescript just makes those types explicit and essentially puts them down.

## Notes

- Yes it compiles, but so do many Javascript projects use `babel`.
